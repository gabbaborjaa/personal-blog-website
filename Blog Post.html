					Earlier in the month, we were introduced to the first ever installment in the Phase 4 Marvel Cinematic Universe as well as the first ever Marvel tv show released on the <em>Disney+</em> streaming platform. I will be writing about my thoughts and justifications about my love for the MCU. It has been about a year and a half since we have seen the latest installment in the MCU. Leaving off with a giant cliffhanger in Spider-Man: Far From Home.<br>

					<div class="article">
						My initial thoughts on WandaVision surpassed what I expected the show to be. Although excited, I was not quite sure of the direction that the narrative was intending to take but after seeing the latest 5 episodes. I can say for sure that I and every one in the audience, both in the show and outside the show, are in for a wild ride.

						We get to see a deeper look into the life of Wanda Maximoff and Elizabeth Olsen has continued to give an outstanding performance at her 5th appearance in the MCU. Noting <em>Age of Ultron</em> as her debut back in 2015, 6 years before <em>WandaVision</em> aired.
					</div>
					<div class="article">I am excited to see where the show is going, especially with the Disney-Fox acquisition behind them; giving them the opportunity to start establishing Fox-related titles in the bigger cinematic multiverse.
