				<h4>About the Author</h4>
				<p>Hi! my name is Gabriel, or Gab for short. I am currently a freshman at Lansing Community College pursuing a career in Front-End Web Development. I was born and raised in the sunny city of Manila in the land of the Philippines. I also graduated from high school in Los Angeles, California. My favorite hobbies are reading good books, playing guitar, playing video games and making great playlists for people. I am currently involved in a college ministry called University Christian Outreach. My goals in life are to establish a foundation in my life here in the U.S, as well as finding a career in the tech industry. I am currently involved in a nanodegree program in Front-End Web Development.<br>
				I found a new interest in writing code and in manipulating web pages and I am excited to see where my career in web development can take me. I love being involved in the ministry that I am a part of, being able to meet different students on campus as well as being in great friendships and relationships in our ministry. I love being able to make people happy as well as just going through life with different people</p>
